    <h1>Pirates Be Sayin Things</h1>
    <p>
        How’d you like to scrape the barnacles off of me rudder? You can always trust the untrustworthy because you can always trust that they will be untrustworthy.
        Its the trustworthy you can’t trust. Yarrrr! there be ony two ranks of leader amongst us pirates! 
        Captain and if your really notorious then it’s Cap’n! You will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. 
        The Code is more like guidelines, really. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. 
        Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality.
        Why are pirates pirates? cuz they arrrrrr Why is the rum gone? 
        And that was done without a single drop of rum… Suddenly you’re like a pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an ear- ring. 
        Even pirates, before they attack another ship, hoist a black flag. “Yes, I do heartily repent. 
        I repent I had not done more mischief; and that we did not cut the throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry that you aren’t hanged as well as we. ”
