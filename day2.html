        An important thing to do before setting off to sea is to get a good crew; a crew you can trust. In selecting a crew you have to think about a few things who do you trust, who do you know that has useful skills, and who can you be trapped with alone together for long periods of time. I chose D-Bo as my first mate because even though he is a dog I trust him with my life. As for Flor I chose her as my quartermaster because when it comes to pirate crews the quartermaster is in charge when the captain and first mate cannot. Also she's one of the most responsible people I know. The choice for my sail master is Siera; she has been obsessed with stars since we were kids and can use them to guide us. Now for my gunner I choose James for the simple reason that he knows way too much about old weaponry and is crazy enough to not fear the damage that could come to him in this position. Lastly we have Mariah she got the position of surgeon since she has the most medical experience of anyone I know. My crew fits my needs with their skills, are some of the few people I trust, and though it might be tough being at sea together I think we'd keep each other sane. With all that being said we definitely always have room for more.

            You’re drinking a Salty Dog? How’d you like to try the real thing? I’ve sailed the seven seas, and you’re the sleekest schooner I’ve ever sighted. Aye, I guarantee ye, I’ve had a twenty percent decrease in me “lice ratio!” The rougher the seas, the smoother we sail. Ahoy! Suddenly you’re like a pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an ear- ring. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. Right from the <span>Voyage</span> og Noah, surviving was by sailing. Avast ye! and sail against the tides.
