    <h1>I Want To Be A Pirate</h1>
    <p>
        I’d love to drop anchor in your lagoon. C’mon, lad, shiver me timbers! Give me freedom or give me the <strong>rope</strong>. 
        For I shall not take the shackles that subjugate the poor to uphold the rich. 
        The average man will bristle if you say his father was dishonest, but he will brag a little if he discovers that his great- grandfather was a <em>pirate</em>. 
        Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all. <strike>Or at least I wish I was.</strike>
